_AsteroidMining_ The Strategy Game
==================================

General Outline
---------------

The idea is to create a strategy game where it is not neccessary to spend a lot of hours every day to compete on a high level. Set in the future where recources on earth are scarce, the player will manage a mining operation in the astroid belt of our solar system. Due to the communication delay between earth and the asteroids robots of ones mission will have to be programed to be successful. Game modes can range from single player to MMO.
